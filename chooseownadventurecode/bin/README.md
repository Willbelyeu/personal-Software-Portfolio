# Future Work

- Change rest to a win condition, ending the game and displaying a victory banner.
- Make the creature(crab) appear in a random beach location so that the player doesn't have to enter the river. Maybe expand crab so that every time one is killed a new one spawns on a random beach, or just give creatures a random spawn chance every time the player enters an appropriate location.
- Expand location class so that it checks the location you just came from in order to give a different notification from each direction.
- Add a time tracker connected to the existing actions taken, and change the events to reflect this. 
- Make charactor exhaustion a more important mechanic by reducing hitchance when attacking if a certain ammount is built up?
- Expand charactor creation and add level ups to the game. Probably would just need to pick one of the base stats each levelup and increase it by a set ammount. This game is built more around exploration than combat, so while there are only so many places to visit the places visited would make sense to at least be equal to combat xp in regard to leveling up.
